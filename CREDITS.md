# Third Party Assets (not included in repository)

You will need to acquire these and place them in the correct directories for the project to work properly.

It's possible and even likely that many dependencies will be removed as time goes on. Nearly all assets will be removed once the demo and library are split, leaving some to form a generic quick-start base. Most assets in Objects/ in particular are resources used in the demo scene, not critical to the functionality of the library.

## Standard Assets

These come with the engine and can be unpacked from within the editor.

Environment/TerrainAssets
	(aesthetic only; can be left out and will still run)

Environment/Water (Basic)
	(aesthetic only; can be left out and will still run)
	
Characters
	(you only need Third Person Character but importing the whole thing should be safe)
